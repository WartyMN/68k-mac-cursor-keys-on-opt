See my 68k-mac-cursor-keys for a version that works when CapsLock is engaged.What this system extension (INIT) doesWhen Option is down, turns a set of normal keys into an inverted T arrangement of cursor keys. There are two variants of the tool, you can choose the one that matches your style best, or try running with both (not recommended for speed/memory reasons, but will work). Variant 1: "Opt Cursors" -- Keys Near BackspaceWhen the Option key is down, it will turn [ key into left cursor, \ key into right cursor, = key into up cursor, ] key into down cursor.       +------+       | +  = |       |      |       |  UP  |+--------------------+| [  { | ]  } | \  | ||      |      |      || LEFT | DOWN | RIGHT|+--------------------+Variant 2: "Opt Cursors IJKL" -- Keys at Right-hand Home PositionWhen the Option key is down, it will turn J into left cursor, L into right cursor, I into up cursor, K into down cursor.       +------+       |   I  |       |      |       |  UP  |+--------------------+|   J  |   K  |   L  ||      |      |      || LEFT | DOWN | RIGHT|+--------------------+Why you might want this:You have an original 128/512 Mac keyboard and wish it had cursor keys You have a Mac Plus keyboard, Apple Desktop Bus Keyboard (“IIGS”), M0116 (II/SE “standard keyboard”), or Apple Keyboard II and wished you had cursor keys in an inverted T arrangement. Maybe you like the original MacWrite and wish it supported cursor keys: with Opt Cursors, it does!How to install it1. Get it onto your Mac somehow2. Expand the .sit.hqx file3. Drop your preferred version of the INIT/extension on your system folder. For System 7+, the Mac will automatically move it into your System Extensions folder. You can install both INITs at the same time if you wish: they have different filenames and icons to help you distinguish.How to use itWhenever you need cursor keys, hold down one of the Option keys, and use [, ], \, and = as cursor keys. All other keys will operate as normal (but Option-modified) keys.How to temporarily disable itHold down the mouse button on startup to disable it until the next reboot.How to uninstall itOpen your System FolderDrag the “Opt Cursors” or “Opt Cursors IJKL” system extension file out of the System FolderRestart your macDoes it have a Control Panel?No. Nothing is configurable, in the interest of keeping size to a minimum.Which systems is it compatible with?Good question. So far, it has been tested with:- Macintosh Plus with 4MB, 6.0.8- Mini vMac - various Mac II and Mac Plus configurations- Basilisk II - Mac IIci - 7.5.5If you test it on another system, please let me know if it works or not. I would expect it to not work perfectly for any language/country that has a different arrangement in that part of the keyboard.Will it work in all apps?No, but it should work in all apps that are well-behaved, and which actually have some kind of cursor-based behavior. It actually works in some apps that do not support the native cursor keys, such as MacWrite.  Your mileage may vary.Can it do my homework?Not currently. All it does is map 4 keys. If you have any idea for other keys, I’m not adverse to mapping more. The only concern I have is that the more keys that get remapped, the more the hit on typing performance might be noticeable. I didn’t do any testing though, so it’s possible it’s not a concern. I’m sure it wouldn’t be on anything faster than a bare 68000.
